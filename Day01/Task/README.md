# Confirm Slack, GitHub, and Google classroom, Discord  Setup
Welcome to prep course ,let’s confirm your accounts are ready for success! Take a moment to create consistent profiles for a few of the key tools you will use: Google classroom , GitHub, discord and Slack. Then introduce yourself in your new class-specific Slack channel.

## Profile Picture
You will need a photograph of your lovely face. Not your cat, flowers . Not a cartoon or bitmoji. Add a nice head-shot so that we can learn your name faster and give you better feedback on assignments. Your profile picture should be identical across The Google classroom , GitHub, discord and Slack.

## Get Familiar with Your Online Tools
Google classroom that lets you submit and track all assignments.

GitHub is the online place to store your code and collaborate with other developers using the Git version control system.

Slack is a nice chat program that will let you communicate directly with classmates, instructors, and TAs.

Discord is a nice ticket program that will let you raise tickets during lab time so TA's will reach out to you and help you directly.

## Google classroom Setup
When you complete your course enrollment, you will get an email inviting you to join the Google classroom for this course. Follow the instructions in the email to get connected.
The most important thing is that you have to have gmail email or account to use google classroom so this is the first step.

## Github Setup
If you already have a GitHub account, Great! Complete any remaining steps.

Go to GitHub.com.
Sign up for a free account.
Let us know a bit about about yourself by setting up your profile section. Display your full name, as it will appear on your resume.
Add your profile picture. Remember, use the same image as your LMS profile and Slack!
Pro Tip: Keep GitHub Presentable
Make sure you are following best practices with your GitHub account to impress any potential employers who view it.

Follow this individual workshop to learn the expectations for your account.

Share a link to your profile, and invite your classmates to “star” your best repos, or follow you if they’d like.

## Slack Setup
Use the link in your welcome email (or potentially found below this frame) to go to the class Slack Workspace and configure your account.

Use your same profile picture, if you haven’t already. Ensure your profile “Full name” field has your full name, as it will appear on your resume.

Send a message in your class Slack channel with a brief introduction.
You can find your class channel under “Channels” in the sidebar.
Your class channel will have the same name as the course code for your class.
In your intro message be sure to include:
Your name, pronouns, location (and timezone?)
Your background and previous experience
Your computer operating system and version number
Why you are excited for this class
Explore the other channels that are available, and feel free to join and participate in any others that look interesting to you.
Slack offers both desktop and mobile application versions. Once your account is configured, download and install both of those, too.

## Discord Setup
